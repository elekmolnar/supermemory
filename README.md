Pairs

This is the homework for the Javascript developer position at Supercharge! You have 3 hours to fulfil this task. Please write us when you start and send it back within 3 hours. When you finished please upload your game to github and share your link with us!

The application you have to create is a memory game with the following details:

You received a stack of cards, so placed them on the “table” faced down. The player will flip two cards face-up, see if they match. If it is, then it will be removed from the table, if it’s not then it flips back. The goal is to match all the cards on the table with as few tries as possible.

Functions:
- Restart: an option to reset the game and randomly reorder the cards on the table
- Set deck size (6 - 20)
- Display the count of the tries
- Show us your extraordinary animation skills
- Show the all-time favourite score
